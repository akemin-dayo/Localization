                //LET'S DO THIS
                "narration.intro_1_00"                        "This is the story of a man named Stanley."
                "narration.intro_1_01"                        "Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was Employee 427."
                "narration.intro_1_02"                        "Employee 427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard."
                "narration.intro_1_03"                        "Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order."
                "narration.intro_1_04"                        "This is what Employee 427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others might have considered it soul rending,"
                "narration.intro_1_05"                        "Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job."
                "narration.intro_1_06"                        "<len:3>And Stanley was happy."
                "narration.intro_2_00"                        "And then one day, something very peculiar happened."
                "narration.intro_2_01"                        "Something that would forever change Stanley;"
                "narration.intro_2_02"                        "something he would never quite forget."
                "narration.intro_2_03"                        "He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow."
                "narration.intro_2_04"                        "No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say 'hi.' Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation."
                "narration.intro_2_05"                        "Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time."
                "narration.intro_2_06"                        "But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office."
                "narration.office_1_00"                        "All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean?"
                "narration.office_1_01"                        "Stanley decided to go to the meeting room; perhaps he had simply missed a memo."
                "narration.office_2_00"                        "No matter how hard Stanley looked, he couldn't find a trace of his co-workers."
                "narration.office_3_00"                        "Stanley went around touching every little thing in the office, but it didn't make a single difference, nor did it advance the story in any way."
                "narration.office_4_00"                        "Stanley clicked on literally every single door in the office, because he doesn't pick up well on cues from his environment."
                "narration.two_doors_00"                        "When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left."
                "narration.meeting_room_00"                "Yet there was not a single person here either."
                "narration.meeting_room_01"                "Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his boss's office, hoping he might find an answer there."
                "narration.staircase_00"                        "Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs to his boss's office."
                "narration.boss_1_00"                        "Stepping into his manager's office, Stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any human life."
                "narration.boss_1_01"                        "Shocked, unraveled, Stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated this, what dark secret was being held from him!"
                "narration.boss_1_02"                        "What he could not have known was that the keypad behind the boss's desk guarded the terrible truth that his boss had been keeping from him,"
                "narration.boss_1_03"                        "and so the boss had assigned it an extra secret pin number: 2-8-4-5."
                "narration.boss_1_04"                        "But, of course, Stanley couldn't possibly have known this."
                "narration.boss_2_00"                        "Stepping into his manager's office, Stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any human life. What could it mean, he wondered."
                "narration.boss_2_01"                        "Desperate for answers, he began turning the room over, looking for clues that might unravel the situation, until at last he discovered a keypad behind the boss's desk."
                "narration.boss_2_02"                        "But, alas, no code. For this keypad guarded the terrible secret that lay buried below his feet,"
                "narration.boss_2_03"                        "and so the boss had assigned it an extra secret pin number: 2-8-4-5."
                "narration.boss_2_04"                        "But, of course, Stanley couldn't possibly have known this."
                "narration.boss_3_00"                        "Stepping into his manager's office, Stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any human life."
                "narration.boss_3_01"                        "What could it mean, Stanley wondered aloud... to nobody."
                "narration.boss_3_02"                        "He began wildly tearing through papers on the boss's desk pulling books off the shelf, looking behind paintings, desperate for clues to his situation."
                "narration.boss_3_03"                        "But his attention was caught by a keypad behind the boss's desk. What could its purpose be?"
                "narration.boss_3_04"                        "In fact, this keypad guarded the terrible secret that lay buried below his feet, and so the boss had assigned it an extra secret pin number: 2-8-4-5."
                "narration.boss_3_05"                        "But, of course, Stanley couldn't possibly have known this."
                "narration.boss_4_00"                        "The moment he entered his manager's office, Stanley froze in his tracks."
                "narration.boss_4_01"                        "Not a living soul anywhere. Could he really be all alone? This was too much for Stanley to take; too much for any man to take!"
                "narration.boss_4_02"                        "He fell to his knees, bursting into half-moans, half-sobs... the guttural retching of life from a man denied any hope, any reason to keep going."
                "narration.boss_4_03"                        "Here on the floor, he lay prone, paralyzed by fear for nearly a full hour, but when at last he began to move about and survey the situation, he found a keypad behind the boss's desk."
                "narration.boss_4_04"                        "What could it mean? Was it a sign of hope for Stanley's future?"
                "narration.boss_4_05"                        "Alas, it was not. For although this keypad guarded the terrible secret of Stanley's past,"
                "narration.boss_4_06"                        "it had been assigned a four-digit code so devious and so random that no man could ever hope to guess it: 2-8-4-5."
                "narration.boss_4_07"                        "Statistically, nearly impossible to guess blindly, ever."
                "narration.boss_delay_1_00"                "Stanley just sat around twiddling his thumbs."
                "narration.boss_delay_1_01"                "Trying to input anything on the device was useless, since he could never possibly know that the combination was 2-8-4-5."
                "narration.boss_delay_2_00"                "<clr:255,0,0>2 - 8 - 4 - 5."
                "narration.boss_delay_3_00"                "For god's- but it turns out that the panel's emergency override kicked in, and the door just opened all by itself,"
                "narration.boss_delay_3_01"                "and Stanley got the hell along with the story. Well, whoop-de-doo."
                "narration.boss_success_00"                "Yet incredibly, by simply pushing random buttons on the keypad, Stanley happened to input the correct code by sheer luck. Amazing."
                "narration.boss_success_01"                "He stepped into the newly opened passageway."
                "narration.boss_interrupt_1_00"        "Stanley was in such a rush to get through the story as quickly as possible, he didn't even have a single minute to just let the narrator talk."
                "narration.boss_interrupt_1_01"        "That kind of anxiety isn't healthy, so he relaxed for a few moments with some calming new age music."
                "narration.boss_interrupt_1_02"        "<sfx>♫ calming new age music ♫"
                "narration.boss_interrupt_1_03"        "Feeling soothed and rejuvenated, Stanley calmly walked forward into the opened passageway."
                "narration.boss_interrupt_2_00"        "Okay, I think we all know the drill by now."
                "narration.boss_interrupt_2_01"        "Blah blah blah, dark secrets, the keypad, Stanley pushes some buttons, oh hey, look, it's a new passageway! Quelle surprise!"
                "narration.boss_interrupt_3_00"        "Here's the door, just go."
                "narration.boss_incorrect_00"        "Stanley simply began random codes into the keypad, knowing full well the sheer statistical unlikelihood that this would ever result in a correct combination."
                "narration.boss_incorrect_01"        "If he knew that the combo was 2-8-4-5, it would be another story entirely. But no. No, this is what he's going to do instead."
                "narration.underground_1_00"        "Descending deeper into the building, Stanley realized he felt a bit peculiar."
                "narration.underground_1_01"        "It was a stirring of emotion in his chest, as though he felt more free to think for himself, to question the nature of his job."
                "narration.underground_1_02"        "Why did he feel this now, when for years it had never occured to him?"
                "narration.underground_1_03"        "This question would not go unanswered for long."
                "narration.underground_2_00"        "Stanley walked straight ahead through the large door that read: 'Mind Control Facility.'"
                "narration.monitor_1_00"                "The lights rose on an enormous room packed with television screens."
                "narration.monitor_1_01"                "What horrible secret did this place hold, Stanley thought to himself. Did he have the strength to find out?"
                "narration.monitor_2_00"                "Now the monitors jumped to life, their true nature revealed."
                "narration.monitor_2_01"                "Each bore the number of an employee in the building, Stanley's co-workers."
                "narration.monitor_2_02"                "The lives of so many individuals reduced to images on a screen, and Stanley one of them, eternally monitored in this place where freedom meant nothing."
                "narration.monitor_3_00"                "This mind control facility... it was too horrible to believe; it couldn't be true."
                "narration.monitor_3_01"                "Had Stanley really been under someone's control all this time? Was this the only reason he was happy with his boring job?"
                "narration.monitor_3_02"                "That his emotions had been manipulated to accept it blindly?"
                "narration.monitor_4_00"                "No! He refused to believe it. He couldn't accept it; his own life in someone else's control? Never!"
                "narration.monitor_4_01"                "It was unthinkable, wasn't it? Was it even possible?"
                "narration.monitor_4_02"                "Had he truly spent his entire life utterly blind to the world?"
                "narration.controls_1_00"                "But here was the proof. The heart of the operation, controls labeled with emotions: 'happy' or 'sad' or 'content.'"
                "narration.controls_1_01"                "Walking, eating, working... all of it monitored and commanded from this very place."
                "narration.controls_1_02"                "And as the cold reality of his past began to sink in, Stanley decided that this machinery would never again exert its terrible power over another human life."
                "narration.controls_1_03"                "For he would dismantle the controls once and for all."
                "narration.controls_2_00"                "And when, at last, he found the source of the room's power, he knew it was his duty, his obligation, to put an end to this horrible place and to everything it stood for."
                "narration.freedom_1_00"                "Blackness... and a rising chill of uncertainty...."
                "narration.freedom_1_01"                "Was it over?"
                "narration.freedom_2_00"                "Yes! He had won."
                "narration.freedom_2_01"                "He had defeated the machine, unshackled himself from someone else's command. Freedom was mere moments away."
                "narration.freedom_2_02"                "And, yet, even as the immense door slowly opened, Stanley reflected on how many puzzles still lay unsolved."
                "narration.freedom_2_03"                "Where had his co-workers gone? How had he been freed from the machine's grasp? What other mysteries did this strange building hold?"
                "narration.freedom_2_04"                "But as sunlight streamed into the chamber, he realized none of this mattered to him. For it was not knowledge, or even power, that he had been seeking, but happiness."
                "narration.freedom_2_05"                "Perhaps his goal had not been to understand, but to let go."
                "narration.freedom_2_06"                "No longer would anyone tell him where to go, what to do, or how to feel. Whatever life he lives, it will be his."
                "narration.freedom_2_07"                "And that was all he needed to know. It was, perhaps, the only thing worth knowing."
                "narration.freedom_2_08"                "Stanley stepped through the open door."
                "narration.freedom_3_00"                "Stanley felt the cool breeze upon his skin, the feeling of liberation, the immense possibility of the new path before him."
                "narration.freedom_3_01"                "This was exactly the way, right now, that things were meant to happen."
                "narration.freedom_3_02"                "And Stanley was happy."
                "narration.countdown_00"                "Oh Stanley, you didn't just activate this controls, did you?"
                "narration.countdown_01"                "After they kept you enslaved all these years you go and you try to take control of the machine for yourself, is that what you wanted? Control?"
                "narration.countdown_02"                "Oh... Stanley. *sigh* I applaud you effort, I really do, but you need to understand; there's only so much that machine can do."
                "narration.countdown_03"                "You were supposed to let it go, turn the controls off, and leave. If you want to throw my story off track, you're going to have to do much better than that."
                "narration.countdown_04"                "I'm afraid you don't have nearly the power you think you do; for example, and I believe you'll find this pertinent:"
                "narration.countdown_05"                "Stanley suddenly realized that he had just initiated the network's emergency detonation system. In the event that this machine is activated without proper DNA identification, nuclear detonators are set to explode, eliminating the entire complex."
                "narration.countdown_06"                "How long until detonation, then? Hmm... let's say, um... two minutes."
                "narration.countdown_07"                "Ah, now this is making things a little more fun, isn't it, Stanley?"
                "narration.countdown_08"                "It's your time to shine! You are the star! It's your story now; shape it to your heart's desires. Ooh, this is much better than what I had in mind! What a shame we have so little time left to enjoy it."
                "narration.countdown_09"                "Mere moments until the bomb goes off, but what precious moments each one of them is! More time to talk about you, about me, where we're going, what all this means... I barely know where to start!"
                "narration.countdown_10"                "What's that? You'd like to know where your co-workers are? A moment of solace before you're obliterated?"
                "narration.countdown_11"                "Alright. I'm in a good mood, and you're going to die anyway. I'll tell you exactly what happened to them: "
                "narration.countdown_12"                "I erased them. I turned off the machine; I set you free."
                "narration.countdown_13"                "Of course, that was merely in this instance of the story. Sometimes when I tell it, I simply let you sit there in your office forever, pushing buttons endlessly and then dying alone."
                "narration.countdown_14"                "Other times, I let the office sink into the ground, swallowing everyone inside; or I let it burn to a crisp."
                "narration.countdown_15"                "I have to say this, though, this version of events has been rather amusing. Watching you try to make sense of everything and take back the control wrested away from you... it's quite rich. I almost hate to see it go!"
                "narration.countdown_16"                "But I'm sure whatever I come up with on the next go around will be even better."

                "narration.windowgag_3_06"        "Well now I've built up the other option so much that I'm going to stop talking and leave you to your decision whether to come back here, continue with the game, or just sit in this spot forever and ever. Cheers."
                "narration.ach430_1_00"                "Oh please, are you really just doing this for the achievement? Click a door 5 times, is THAT all that you think an achievement is worth? No no no, I can't just give these merits away for such little effort, a measly five clicks."
                "narration.ach430_1_01"                "Now, suppose you were to click the door TWENTY times, I would say THAT's the kind of effort that warrants recognition!"
                "narration.ach430_2_00"                "Hm. I have to say, I'm still not feeling the satisfaction of witnessing true effort for a noble cause. Perhaps fifty clicks will do it. Yes, almost certainly fifty clicks."
                "narration.ach430_3_00"                "No, no I'm still not feeling it. I want this achievement to have MEANT something, it has to be a true reward for valiant effort! I want to see some hustle Stanley, I want to see commitment, a willingness to go all the way, no matter what the cost!"
                "narration.ach430_3_01"                "Why don't you go put twenty clicks into door number 417?"
                "narration.ach430_4_00"                "Ok great, now go click a few times on door 437."
                "narration.ach430_5_00"                "Excellent, I think we're getting somewhere. Now door 415, let's give it ten clicks or so."
                "narration.ach430_6_00"                "Now back to door number 437."
                "narration.ach430_7_00"                "Let's see, how about you click on, well I don't know, the copy machine?"
                "narration.ach430_8_00"                "Alright back to room 417! I'm really feeling it now, I think we're getting somewhere!"
                "narration.ach430_9_00"                "Okay now go climb on employee 419's desk."
                "narration.ach430_10_00"        "Yes! This is great! You're putting it all on the line Stanley, I like that! Alright let's keep it up, go give me a few clicks on door 416!"
                "narration.ach430_11_00"        "We've almost got it! Now the copy machine, do that one again!"
                "narration.ach430_12_00"        "Finish it off, Stanley, 5 clicks on door 430!!"
                "narration.ach430_13_00"        "YES!! WE DID IT!! Oh wow, that felt amazing! You really earned it, Stanley, nothing could hold you back! I'm very proud of how far we've come today."
                "narration.ach430_13_01"        "Just think, only a few minutes ago you believed an achievement was worth five little clicks. Really now, what WERE you thinking."
